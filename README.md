Technologies Used:

I used h2 database as it is a pure java embedded database. At the time being the data set would be small meaning a h2 database would be suitable.

I used a wildfly server to host my database and application as it supports Java EE better than others such as Tomcat. 

I used ajax to send xhr to the database as it is a simple tool to use and supports the json format. 

I used junit and selenium to test my application. The backend was tested solely using JUnit where as front end functionality was testing using Junit
and the selenium webdriver.
